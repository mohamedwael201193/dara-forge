# 0G Compute Integration Setup

## Development Mode (Current)

The application is currently running in development mode with mock 0G Compute responses. This allows for testing and development without requiring actual 0G provider credentials.

## Production Deployment

To enable real 0G Compute in production, set these environment variables:

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# 0G Compute Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
OG_COMPUTE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
OG_COMPUTE_RPC=https://evmrpc-testnet.0g.ai
ZG_COMPUTE_PROVIDER=0xf07240Efa67755B5311bc75784a061eDB47165Dd
ZG_COMPUTE_ENDPOINT=https://your-0g-provider-endpoint
```

### Setup Steps

1. **Get 0G Test Tokens**

   - Visit the 0G testnet faucet
   - Fund your wallet with test A0GI tokens

2. **Provider Setup**

   - The system uses the official 0G provider: `0xf07240Efa67755B5311bc75784a061eDB47165Dd`
   - Ledger will be automatically created with 0.01 OG funding
   - Provider acknowledgment happens automatically

3. **Deploy to Production**

   ```bash
   # Build for production
   npm run build

   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```

## Features
