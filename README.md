## Technical Implementation

### 0G Integration Architecture

    A[User Interface] --> B(API Endpoints)
    B --> C(0G Storage API)
    B --> D(0G Chain (Galileo))
    A --> D
```

### 0G Technology Stack Utilization

#### 0G Storage

```typescript
// Dataset upload to 0G Storage
const uploadResponse = await 0gSdk.storage.uploadDirectory(
  files,
  { token: process.env.OG_API_KEY }
);
const datasetRoot = uploadResponse.root;
```

#### 0G Verification

```typescript
// Verify dataset integrity
const verificationResult = await 0gSdk.storage.verify(
  datasetRoot,
  { token: process.env.OG_API_KEY }
);
```

#### 0G Chain (Galileo Testnet)

```typescript
// Commit dataset root to 0G Chain
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  ANCHOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  ANCHOR_CONTRACT_ABI,
  signer
);
const tx = await contract.anchorData(datasetRoot);
await tx.wait();
```

## Why This Project Is Waveâ€‘1 Ready (Mapped to Judging Criteria)

**Working Demo & Functionality (30%)** â€” The live demo demonstrates the full flow endâ€‘toâ€‘end: upload to 0G Storage, compute dataset and manifest roots, verify integrity via Merkle proofs, anchor on 0G Chain (Galileo), handle propagation gracefully, and allow proofâ€‘verified downloads. The happy path is clear and reproducible for judges.

**0G Tech Stack Integration (30%)** â€” The app integrates multiple 0G services in concert: Storage (upload/verify), Chain (onâ€‘chain anchoring and explorer linking), and the Indexer (propagation and retrieval). The README documents exact endpoints and chain parameters so judges can follow along.

**Creativity & UX (15%)** â€” The UI is intentionally simple and focused, with clear states during propagation ("Propagatingâ€¦" instead of false negatives), visible verification badges, and a proofâ€‘aware download button that only enables when ready. Copy actions reduce friction when sharing roots or tx hashes.

**Real Use Case & Scalability (10%)** â€” The flow generalizes to any domain that requires verifiable datasets (research, compliance, ML benchmarks). The architecture is modular and can scale by adding multiâ€‘wallet support, SIWE authentication, or 0G Compute jobs in the next waves.

**Vision & Roadmap (10%)** â€” A concrete roadmap is included below for Waveâ€‘2/3 that adds authentication, multiâ€‘wallet, discovery, and compute, with minimal churn to the current code.
