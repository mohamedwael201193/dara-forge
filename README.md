```

### 0G Storage Integration

```typescript
// Upload files to 0G Storage with Merkle root generation.
const uploadResponse = await 0gSdk.storage.uploadDirectory(files, {
  token: process.env.OG_API_KEY
});

// Verify uploaded data integrity
const verifyResponse = await 0gSdk.storage.verify(root, {
  token: process.env.OG_API_KEY
});

// Download files with cryptographic proof
const downloadResponse = await 0gSdk.storage.downloadWithProof(root, filePath, {
  token: process.env.OG_API_KEY
});
```

### 0G Chain Integration

```typescript
// Connect to 0G Galileo testnet
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

// Log dataset root to 0G Chain using DaraLogger contract
const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, DARA_ABI, signer);
const tx = await contract.logData(datasetRoot);
const receipt = await tx.wait();

console.log(`Dataset logged on 0G Chain: ${receipt.hash}`);
```

### Environment Variables

To enable 0G Compute functionality, the following environment variables are required:

- `OG_RPC_URL`: RPC URL for the 0G network.
- `OG_COMPUTE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for the wallet used by the compute service.
- `OG_MIN_LEDGER_BALANCE` (Optional): Minimum ledger balance required (default: 0.01).
- `OG_BOOTSTRAP_LEDGER` (Optional): Initial ledger amount to add if balance is zero (default: 0.05).
- `OG_REFILL_AMOUNT` (Optional): Amount to refill the ledger if balance falls below minimum (default: 0.05).

These variables should be set in your Vercel project settings or in a `.env.local` file for local development.

## üöÄ Updates in Wave 2

üöÄ **DARA Forge Wave 2: From Vision to Verified Reality on 0G**

We've achieved a significant breakthrough with DARA now LIVE, featuring robust integration with 0G Storage. This enables the processing of real research data with cryptographic verification, ensuring data integrity and trustworthiness. Our focus for Wave 2 has been on expanding DARA into a truly collaborative research ecosystem.

**Key Updates & Deliverables:**

- **Full 0G Storage Integration:** Implemented comprehensive 0G Storage capabilities, allowing for secure and verifiable storage of research datasets. This includes handling of file uploads, generation of root hashes, and tracking of storage transactions, all verifiable on the 0G Storage Explorer (e.g., [https://storagescan-galileo.0g.ai/history](https://storagescan-galileo.0g.ai/history)).

- **Enhanced Wallet Integration & Authentication:** We've significantly improved user accessibility and security by integrating multi-wallet support. Users can now seamlessly connect their wallets via Reown, WalletConnect, Coinbase, and SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum). This provides a flexible and secure authentication mechanism for researchers.

- **Real-time Balance Display:** The application now prominently displays wallet balances, offering users immediate visibility into their assets and facilitating smoother interactions within the DARA ecosystem.

- **Collaborative Research Ecosystem Foundation:** By focusing on robust 0G Storage and advanced authentication, DARA is evolving beyond a data verification tool into a platform that fosters collaboration. This wave lays the groundwork for future features like versioning, batch uploads, rich metadata, and smart contract-enabled role-based project management.

**Vision for the Future:**

By the end of Wave 2, DARA has transformed into a collaborative research ecosystem powered by 0G, setting the stage for deeper integration with 0G Compute and 0G DA in subsequent waves. Our aim is to provide a definitive, trustless infrastructure for reproducible science, ensuring that every piece of research data is verifiable, secure, and accessible.
