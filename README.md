DARA Forge: Decentralized AI Research Assistant




🚀 Project Overview
DARA Forge revolutionizes scientific research by providing a decentralized platform for storing, verifying, and sharing research datasets with cryptographic integrity guarantees. Built on 0G's modular blockchain infrastructure, DARA Forge ensures that research data remains tamper-proof, verifiable, and permanently accessible.
🎯 Key Problems Solved

* Data Integrity: Research data can be cryptographically verified against tampering
* Transparent Provenance: Clear lineage of dataset origins and modifications
* Permanent Record: Dataset proofs anchored on-chain for immutable references
* Open Science: Promotes reproducibility and verification in scientific research

0G Storage Integration
DARA Forge uses 0G Storage for decentralized, verifiable storage of research datasets:
typescriptDownloadCopy code Wrap// Upload files to 0G Storage with Merkle root generation
const uploadResponse = await 0gSdk.storage.uploadDirectory(files, {
  token: process.env.OG_API_KEY
});

// Verify uploaded data integrity
const verifyResponse = await 0gSdk.storage.verify(root, {
  token: process.env.OG_API_KEY
});

// Download files with cryptographic proof
const downloadResponse = await 0gSdk.storage.downloadWithProof(root, filePath, {
  token: process.env.OG_API_KEY
});
0G Chain Integration
Research dataset roots are permanently anchored on the 0G Galileo Chain:
typescriptDownloadCopy code Wrap// Connect to 0G Galileo testnet
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();

// Commit dataset root to 0G Chain
const contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, ABI, signer);
const tx = await contract.anchorData(datasetRoot);
const receipt = await tx.wait();

// Transaction hash serves as permanent proof of anchoring
console.log(`Dataset anchored on 0G Chain: ${receipt.hash}`);

🧪 How It Works

1. Upload Dataset: Researchers upload their datasets to 0G Storage
2. Generate Merkle Root: The system computes a unique cryptographic root for the dataset
3. Verify Integrity: Dataset integrity is verified using Merkle proofs
4. Anchor On-Chain: Dataset root is permanently committed to 0G Chain
5. Download with Proof: Anyone can download the dataset with cryptographic proof of integrity
